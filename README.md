- 👋 Hi, I’m Michael Geerts, born in Merksem, a suburb of Antwerpen, the biggest port in Belgium.
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things, except stupid time-consuming brain-damaging mind-controlling watching TV, the book is always better ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to improve my web skills. HTML and CSS I can write and use, JavaScript is next on my list, then Python. But I also use AI since it is so easy to create and combined with my knowledge of HTML and CSS, I can easily make a front-end website with basic knowledge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on front-end creation since my knowledge is limited.
- 📫 How to reach me: mail: michaelgeerts8@gmail.com
