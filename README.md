- 👋 Hi, I’m Michael Geerts, born in Merksem, a suburb of Antwerpen, the biggest port in Belgium
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things, except stupid time consuming brain damaging mind controlling watching TV, the book is always better ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to improve my webskills. HTML and CSS I can write and use, javascript is next on my list, then Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on easy tasts since my knowledge is limited.
- 📫 How to reach me: mail: michaelgeerts8@gmail.com
